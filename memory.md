# Better Viewlift — Project Memory

Context file for AI assistants (GPT/Codex, Claude, etc.) picking up work on this repo.

## What this is

"Better Viewlift" (formerly "Better CMS") is a Tampermonkey userscript toolkit that adds
productivity tooling on top of two internal ViewLift systems:

- **Freshdesk** (`viewlift.freshdesk.com`) — support ticketing
- **CMS** (`cms.viewlift.com`, `cms-gcp.viewlift.com`, `cms-qcp.viewlift.com`,
  `cms.monumentalsportsnetwork.com`) — the internal content/customer management system

It's built and maintained by the repo owner (GitHub: `Pepperoni-mc`), author tags in the
scripts read "Happy, Potato". Development has been done with AI coding assistants (GPT/Codex,
and now Claude Code) rather than a team.

Repo: `https://github.com/Pepperoni-mc/viewlift-userscripts.git` (remote `origin`, branch `main`).

## Why two delivery mechanisms (userscript + extension)

The core toolkit is a single Tampermonkey userscript (`better-viewlift.user.js`), installed via
raw GitHub URL with `@updateURL`/`@downloadURL` so it auto-updates.

The **ViewLift Helper** Chrome extension is a separate, optional companion: Tampermonkey/`html2canvas`
screenshots trigger Chrome's screen-share permission prompt every time. The extension uses the
`tabs` API instead, so CMS screenshots (refund captures) happen with no prompt. It has to be
side-loaded as an unpacked extension (Chrome doesn't allow silent extension installs from a
userscript) — see README "Install" section. It's also been submitted to the Chrome Web Store
(hence the packaged zips and privacy policy).

## What the toolkit actually does

**Freshdesk side:**
- Adds a `CMS` button on tickets that opens CMS and auto-searches the customer's email
- Cleans up reply text after "Apply" (dedupes greetings/paragraphs, spacing, quote markers)
- Auto-bolds boilerplate ("Technical Support Team", "Regards,")

**CMS side:**
- Refund capture panel: captures email, Freshdesk URL, CMS URL, payment handler, refund amount;
  remembers the selected refunder (persisted via `GM_setValue`)
- Auto-fills cancellation reason
- Camera snapshot button next to customer name, and on the Customer Support search page
  (via html2canvas, or via the extension's no-prompt tab capture when installed)
- Payment handler badge next to the camera button
- Hides its own helper UI from screenshots
- Handles CMS account switching (classic + v5 CMS UIs) and keeps sessions alive/warm so the
  Freshdesk → CMS handoff doesn't hit a logged-out state
- Works across CMS's internal SPA-style navigation without a full page refresh

**Reading:** the last stretch of work was building and polishing the ViewLift Helper Chrome
extension (screenshot-without-prompt) and preparing it for the Chrome Web Store (icons, privacy
policy, listing screenshot). Before that, the focus was CMS account-switching/session
reliability (classic vs v5 CMS UI) and refund-flow robustness.

## Current repo state (as of 2026-08-09)

Working tree is clean except **untracked** build artifacts that have never been committed:
- `extension/better-viewlift-capture/icon128-resized.png`
- `extension/icon128.png`
- `extension/viewlift-helper-v1.0.1-upload.zip`

These look like Web Store submission assets — worth checking with the user before adding to git
(may be intentionally kept local, or just forgotten `git add`s).

Extension manifest is at `1.0.2`, but only `v1.0.1-upload.zip` is present untracked (no `v1.0.2`
zip yet) and there's also a stray `v1.0.1-final.zip` and `v1.0.2-final.zip` already tracked —
naming isn't fully consistent (`-upload` vs `-final`).

## Notes for future sessions

- No test suite, no build step — these are hand-edited userscripts loaded directly by Tampermonkey.
  "Testing" means loading the script in a browser against real Freshdesk/CMS and clicking through.
- No CLAUDE.md exists in this repo; this `memory.md` is the closest thing to project docs beyond
  the README.

## Deep architecture findings (2026-08-09 analysis)

`better-viewlift.user.js` is a **mechanical merge of two formerly-separate scripts, never
reorganized**: guard (24-29) → IIFE A lines 31-5640 (the old "Better CMS") → IIFE B lines
5642-9411 (the old "Better Freshdesk"), pasted back to back. Proof: each IIFE restarts its own
"Feature 1, 2, 3..." numbering from scratch, out of order. Because the two IIFEs are separate
scopes, helpers like `isVisible`/`cleanText`/`realClick` are reimplemented independently on each
side instead of shared.

**Consequence:** each side brought its own "SPA change detector" (MutationObserver + backup
setInterval + its own pushState/replaceState/popstate patch), so **8-10 near-identical
detector instances run in parallel** on every CMS/Freshdesk page load. The two full
history.pushState-patching blocks (~1911-1934 and ~5502-5525) are almost byte-identical copies.

**Dead code (~450 lines, safe to delete, already identified, not yet removed):**
- Lines 4729-4762: "Feature 3 Legacy" — injects a huge inline `<script>` string, but its own
  guard (`window.__betterCmsV5PercentageRefundInstalled`, line 4744) is always already `true`
  because the maintained module right above (4347-4351) sets it unconditionally first. Never
  executes.
- Lines 6479-6601: "Ticket Tracker integration" — starts with a literal `return;` on line 6483
  (comment says "removed from Better Freshdesk") but the ~120 lines of dead logic below it are
  **the existing scaffold for talking to the case-tracker bot at `135.181.37.72:3001`** (line
  6488) — this is the natural starting point if/when that integration gets reactivated inside
  better-viewlift.user.js itself instead of the separate schn-case-tracker.user.js.

**Fixed-timeout cascades (the direct "make it feel faster" lever):** ~6 near-identical spots
fire a fixed sequence of `setTimeout`s (e.g. lines 2719-2723: `300,700,1200,2000,3000`ms; lines
5531-5535, 8016-8020, 8220-8222, 9156-9159) instead of resolving as soon as the target element
appears. Every one of these is guaranteed wasted latency on the common case where the element
was ready well before the last timeout fires.

**CMS host/UI detection is copy-pasted, not centralized:** the same hostname regex
(`/^(?:cms(?:-gcp|-qcp)?\.viewlift\.com|cms\.monumentalsportsnetwork\.com)$/i`) is redeclared
in 8+ places instead of one shared `isCMSHost()`; there's no shared `isV5UI()` either — each
feature re-detects v5 by sniffing MUI classes (`.MuiSelect-select`, etc.) on its own.

**Fragile selectors worth hardening reactively** (matches past commits like `2df8afc Fix v5
account option detection`): line 388 (`p.break-all` Tailwind utility class), line 943-944
(Ember Power Select classes), the MUI class selectors in the refund-percentage module
(4340-4728), and the 4-selector fallback cascade at 6544-6548 (a sign it already broke once).

**Cross-tab snapshot race** (lines 4784/6614, consumer polls every 900ms at line 6742): two
snapshot requests within 900ms of each other can silently clobber each other since it's one
`GM_setValue` key with no queue.

**There's a THIRD script, not in this repo, discovered live on 2026-08-09:** a `#schn-reply-with-bot`
button ("🤖 Reply with Bot") is injected into the Freshdesk ticket header — same `schn-` naming
convention as `schn-case-tracker.user.js`, but its own separate userscript. This confirms the
bot at `135.181.37.72:3001` ("ViewLift Support Assistant", a FastAPI + React app, login-gated,
`POST /api/ticket-tracker/` with `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>`) does more than tracking —
it can also generate/suggest replies. That script's source wasn't in `scripts/`, so its exact
behavior is unconfirmed; worth asking the user directly before assuming what it does.

**Priority order suggested by this analysis (highest impact/effort ratio first):**
1. Delete the ~450 lines of confirmed dead code — zero risk.
2. Unify the 8-10 duplicate SPA-detector instances into one shared route-change engine — biggest
   perceived-speed and CPU win, but touches most modules, needs the double-IIFE flattened first.
3. Replace the fixed-timeout cascades with the unified engine's "wait for element" — direct
   latency win per ticket.
4. Extract shared helpers (`waitFor`, `isVisible`, `cleanText`, `isCMSHost`) once flattened.
5. Harden fragile selectors — reactively, unless getting ahead of it is wanted.
